# Riak Recap Blog

This is the repo for the [Riak Recap Blog](#). The Recap is a thrice-weekly email, typically delivered each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, sent to the Riak Users Mailing List to keep list subscribers up-to-date on what's happening in and around the Riak Community. You can read more about why the Recap is written [here](http://www.themarkphillips.com/2010/07/17/Why-I-Write-the-Riak-Recap-Every-Day.html).

Some developers and Riak fans wanted to read the Recaps without having to subscribe the mailing list (which is relatively high-volume). So, in the interest of expanding the community and accommodating more users, we started a blog that mirrors the content of the Recap emails.
