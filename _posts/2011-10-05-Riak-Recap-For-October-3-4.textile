# Greg Pascale and the crew at Clipboard "successfully performed a rolling upgrade to 1.0 running LevelDB from Bitcask":http://twitter.com/#!/gregpascale/statuses/121690312925122560. I was wondering if anyone else had details (good or bad) on upgrades they've done to 1.0 or from Bitcask to LevelDB. Any and all info is valuable. Email *mark@basho.com* with details.
