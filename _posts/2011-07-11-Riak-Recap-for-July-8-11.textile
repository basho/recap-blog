_Riak Recap for July 8 - 10_

#  Q: If I've attached to a node using "riak attach", is there a way to clear the state of all the variables, etc.?
   A: f().
# The team at "Boundary":https://boundary.com/ just released a library called Scalang. It's a "scala wrapper that makes it easy to write services that interface with Erlang." While I'm unaware of anyone who is using Riak with Scalang (just yet...), I thought I would pass it along as it opens up some interesting possibilities for anyone who was looking for a simple way to make Scala and Erlang (and Riak) play nice.

# One job to pass along:
-> Ideeli is hiring engineers with Riak, MySQL and MongoDB experience. Details "here":http://bit.ly/nEpalu.
