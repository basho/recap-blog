*Riak Recap for August 19 - 21*

# We announced a Riak 1.0 Webinar today. This is happening on Sept 28th and will feature Justin Sheehy and Andy Gross talking about why the next Riak release will be downright amazing.

#  Q --- Is there some way to remove an empty bucket? (via #riak)
   A --- If it's empty, it doesn't exist. Buckets are just namespaces + properties.
# Another reminder that Riak will be the topic of conversation at the
upcoming Seattle Scalability Meetup this Wednesday.
