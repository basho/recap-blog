* Port of Basho Blog to Jekyll

** How To Post a Blog
  1. [[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install][Install Jekyll]] if you haven't already done so.
  2. Clone this repo (or pull the latest if you already have it)
  3. Add your post to the _posts dir
     + Format for post name must be "YYYY-MM-DD.title.markup"
     + Markup can be HTML, Markdown, or Textile
     + Each post must have the appropriate YML header (*See any post in _post for example of what this needs to contain*)
  4. Generate the blog locally:
     + cd into basho_blog
     + $ jekyll --server  (This will build the blog locally and serve it up on localhost:4000/) (There are a whole mess of wacky config. options
       [[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/configuration][here]].)
     + Your new post should be the first listed.
  5. Proofread!!
  6. Commit and push new post to "publish" branch
